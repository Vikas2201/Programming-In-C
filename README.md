# programming-in-C-C++

Hi , I'm Vikas and This is my Compiled C++ Programs Codes That I have Learned in my B.Tech Journey at Netaji Subhas University of Technology as a Computer Engineering Undergraduate. I hope This will come useful. Feel free to contribute to this repositry, I'll Happily accept any pull Requests or issues.

# LINKED LIST üëé

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
