# Stack
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. In contrast to a queue, a stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) structure.A real-life example is a stack of plates: you can only take a plate from the top of the stack, and you can only add a plate to the top of the stack.

The main stack operations are:

* push(data) :- Adds an element to the top of the stack
* pop()	:- Removes an element from the top of the stack
* peek() / top() :-	Returns a copy of the element on the top of the stack without removing it
* empty() :- Checks whether a stack is empty
* full() :-	Checks whether a stack is at maximum capacity when stored in a static (fixed-size) structure
