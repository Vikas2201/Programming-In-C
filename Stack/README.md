# Stack
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. In contrast to a queue, a stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) structure.A real-life example is a stack of plates: you can only take a plate from the top of the stack, and you can only add a plate to the top of the stack.

The main stack operations are:

* push(data) :- Adds an element to the top of the stack
* pop()	:- Removes an element from the top of the stack
* peek() / top() :-	Returns a copy of the element on the top of the stack without removing it
* empty() :- Checks whether a stack is empty
* full() :-	Checks whether a stack is at maximum capacity when stored in a static (fixed-size) structure

# Queue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Queues are a type of container adaptors which operate in a first in first out (FIFO) type of arrangement. Elements are inserted at the back (end) and are deleted from the front. Queues use an encapsulated object of deque or list (sequential container class) as its underlying container, providing a specific set of member functions to access its elements.

The functions supported by queue are : 

empty() :– Returns whether the queue is empty.
size() :– Returns the size of the queue.
queue::front() and queue::back() :– front() function returns a reference to the first element of the queue. back() function returns a reference to the last element of the queue.
push(g) and pop() :– push() function adds the element ‘g’ at the end of the queue. pop() function deletes the first element of the queue.
